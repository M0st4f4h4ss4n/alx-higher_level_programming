# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

`Python`  `UnitTest`  `TDD`

#### Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:
> - [Never forget a test](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/47)


## Background Context

### Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects

Starting from today:

> - Based on the requirements of each task, __you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first,__ before you actually code anything
> - The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
> - We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. __But not in the implementation of them!__
> - __Don’t trust the user__, always think about all possible edge cases

## Resorces

### Read or watch:
> - [doctest -- Test interactive Python examples]() (_until "26.2.3.7. Warnings"_ )
